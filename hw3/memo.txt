For the first problem, I implemented the textbook school multiplication method. It is naive, and has a runtime of n^2

                //Textbook multiplication method, not optimal (n^2)
                //Multiply two numbers as taught in school
                // 123
                //x 49
                //----
                //  49
                //x123
                //----
