//System.out.println("Output: " + x);
"Output: 3"
 is outputted, because the variable x in the object O is shadowed by the variable x in the method's parameter.

//System.out.println("Output: " + O.x);
"Output: 5"
 is outputted, since the value of the member x in the object O has been changed by "this.x = 5".

//System.out.println("Output: " + o.x);
"Output: 5"
 is outputted because all instances of O share the same variable x.
